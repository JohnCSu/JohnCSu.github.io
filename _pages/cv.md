# Work Experience
---
## 2020 – **Present** Application Engineer at Simuserv LTD

- Performing finite element analysis consultancy, training, and
  technical assistance with Abaqus and Simulia related products across
  Australia and New Zealand

- Taught Abaqus and FEA design to professional engineers.

<!-- -->

- Project lead on simulating the thermal stress response from welding
  using Abaqus FEA. The results were compared with real-life
  measurements and our simulations results were able to show that the
  measurements were not correctly performed.

- Modelling a carbon-fibre composite tyre for the automobile industry

##  2022-2023 Research assistant for University of Sydney

- Investigating the use of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to
  solve forward and inverse differential equations. The focus examined
  recover fluid velocity with limited temperature or concentration data.

- Created a python framework for post-processing LS-Dyna simulations
  allowing researchers to view simulation results in near real time and
  generate results without needing to transfer simulation data.

## 2022 – 2023 Avionics Engineer for University of Sydney Rocketry Team

- Design of avionics bay and camera bay using SolidWorks

## 2018 - 2019 Research assistant at the University of Auckland

- Chemical analysis of electrospray ionization via theta capillaries
- Bond graphs – Graphical representation of metaphysical systems
